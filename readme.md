# Outlook Notification

New email notification (desktop / iOS push) for Outlook Web App

You need to have access to Microsoft EWS (Exchange Web Sercice)

## ALSO TRY THUNDERBIRD!

With the Thunderbird extension:
* [ExQuilla](https://exquilla.zendesk.com/home) - for email
* [Exchange EWS Provider Add-on for Lightning](http://www.1st-setup.nl/wordpress/?page_id=133) - for calendar (require lightning)

You can get email / calendar working (under Linux and other OS) in Thunderbird instead of webmail! It can replace desktop notification. 

If you are still interested in mobile notification (iOS push), keep reading.

### Running Outlook Web App with Linux Chrome

Linux Chrome is not in the official support list, but we can spoof user agent as other browser (e.g. Firefox on Windows) using this extension:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg

After installation, go to settings, and add Your webmail URL (e.g. "wmail.tabcorp.com.au") to "Permanent Spoof list", so it will only affect outlook web app
